This portfolio was developed as a side project during my time at [Trybe][trybe-url] to showcase some of my skills, projects and serve as an extension of my LinkedIn. It contains a header, hero and footer and is divided into five main sections: About, Skills, Services, Portfolio and Contact. It responds well to different display sizes and allows you to switch between a light and dark theme.
